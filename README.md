# Welcome to CLiC.notebooks!

## What is this about?
Coding a software solution to a real-life healthcare problem. Along the way we will explore Machine Learning through an open dataset, deploy our solution model as a web application and question the ethical implications of what we have created.

GitHub will serve as the platform for our first informatics project. If you have no experience with GitHub, Google Colab or anything related to coding don't worry. This project is designed for everyone to participate.

Google Colab is like any other Google Doc. Just click the link below and you've got a full-fledged development environment already configured for computing on the cloud (you'll need a Google or gmail account to use it).

## A Health Data Project
We'll begin with an open-source de-identified dataset on hospital readmissions. The first step will be to get to know our data. We'll apply some data science principles to describe the data and visualize it.
