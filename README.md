# Welcome to CLiC.notebooks!

## What is this about?
Coding a software solution to a real-life healthcare problem. Along the way we will explore Machine Learning through an open dataset, deploy our solution model as a web application and question the ethical implications of what we have created.

Google Colab is like any other Google Doc. Just click the link below and you've got a full-fledged development environment already configured for computing on the cloud (you'll need a Google or gmail account to use it).

## A Health Data Project
We'll begin with an open-source de-identified dataset on hospital readmissions. The first step will be to get to know our data. We'll apply some data science principles to describe the data and visualize it.

### [Visit the first notebook in Google Colab here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Clinical-Informatics-Interest-Group/CLiC.notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/notebook1.ipynb#scrollTo=DkFl9upeZHgs)

### [Session 2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Clinical-Informatics-Interest-Group/CLiC.notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/notebook2.ipynb)
In the second session we will build our first Machine Learning model, a Random Forest Classifier. We'll investigate how well the trained model applies to the "real world" (in this case the Test subset of the data), and experiment how training the model with or without different features could impact patients.
