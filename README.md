# Welcome to CLiC.notebooks!

## What is this about?
Coding a software solution to a real-life healthcare problem. Along the way we will explore Machine Learning through an open dataset, deploy our solution model as a web application and question the ethical implications of what we have created.

Google Colab is like any other Google Doc. Just click the link below and you've got a full-fledged development environment already configured for computing on the cloud (you'll need a Google or gmail account to use it).

## A Health Data Project
We'll begin with an open-source de-identified dataset on hospital readmissions. The first step will be to get to know our data. We'll apply some data science principles to describe the data and visualize it.

### [Session 2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Clinical-Informatics-Interest-Group/CLiC.notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/notebook2.ipynb)
In the second session we will build our first Machine Learning models by following the protocol established by [fast.ai](https://docs.fast.ai/), an organization dedicated to making Machine Learning accessible to everyone.
